# Are men really more lonely?: A data-driven investigation into the Male Loneliness Epidemic
#### The streamlit file is called: MLE_Story.py. The data cleaning and exploration is in the "data_exploration.ipynb" file.
## Reflection: 
### Design Decisions
During user feedback, I got the hear some feedback from classmates regarding my first few visualizations, which were positive about the way I showed the decrease of happiness scores and satisfaction over time. For my research question, there are a number of confounding variables that could possibly alter the narrative, and a peer brought up a great point during peer feedback: “The one worry I would have is whether or not marriage rates are lower because of a low opinion of men and dating culture or other, non-related factors.” I decided to not look into marriage rates because of this comment from a peer during the feedback portion, and instead shift into looking into gendered differences in socialization habits. I selected variables based on the types of socialization that were highlighted in the articles I read in the research stage from the General Social Survey Data Explorer.

From this point on, my design decisions became about viewing if there were significant gendered differences in socialization between men and women. Some attempts were made as I was initially graphing survey data, and I flipped the axes of the percentages of the surveyed population in my y-axes and the categories (frequencies) of responses. I decided to show the differences by color-coding the male and female bars of the bar charts. I think this method was effective in this iteration. 

### Changes for Future Iterations 
To better evidence my data’s story, I would try to combine the charts and conduct statistical significance testing for the differences between men and women. I might also want to visualize social networks with network graphs to show the differences between male and female support systems. 

### Who is Excluded
As I mentioned in the data story, I think this entire issue is framed in very binary terms that may directly or indirectly pit men and women against each other. People who do not identify with binary terms are excluded from this narrative. 


### What I Enjoyed
When we were learning to create data narratives, I enjoyed viewing other data stories and noticed that a lot of journalism is data journalism nowadays. I liked researching my topic the most and the writing/storytelling part of creating this project.
